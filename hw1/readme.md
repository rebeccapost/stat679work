Homework1 has 3 exercises.
1. Exercise1: normalizeFileNames.sh
This exercise normalized the filenames so that the numbers went from 01-13, instead of 1-13.
2. Exercise2: summarizeSNaQres.sh
This exercise creates a table containing the allowable number of hybridizations in each analysis and the elapsed time of each anaylsis. This outputs a csv file titled summarizeSNaQres.csv.
